On the predecessor to this site, I had built a view counting widget in the footer. It was a basic bit of code
that just queried [CountAPI](https://countapi.xyz/) to increment a counter. I didn't want to use a database as the
Site was a simple static react app on github pages.

Unfortunately, out of the blue, CountAPI got bought out by APILayer and the service was shut down. I wasn't able to
find a replacement service, so I decided to build my own.

I took this as an opportunity to learn golang and to try and build a truly scalable and robust API. I also wanted to
learn how to use the [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework.

The project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/abacus) and the demo is available at
[https://abacus.jasoncameron.dev](https://abacus.jasoncameron.dev).
