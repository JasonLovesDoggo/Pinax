# Setting Up code-server with Caddy and Tailscale for Secure Remote Development

In this blog post, we'll walk through how to set up a secure, remote development environment using **code-server**, a web-based interface for VS Code, alongside **Caddy** as a reverse proxy and **Tailscale** for secure networking. This setup allows you to access your development environment from anywhere, securely and efficiently.

## What You'll Need

- A machine (Linux, macOS, or Windows) where you can install software.
- Basic command-line knowledge.
- A Tailscale account (free for personal use).
- Internet access.

## Why This Setup?

- **code-server**: Provides a web-based interface for VS Code, allowing you to develop anywhere.
- **Caddy**: A modern, easy-to-use web server that can act as a reverse proxy.
- **Tailscale**: Securely connects your devices over the internet as if they're on the same local network.

Combining these tools gives you a secure, fast, and flexible development environment accessible from anywhere.

## Step 1: Install code-server

### Installation

You can install **code-server** using `npm` (Node.js package manager):

```bash
# Install Node.js if not installed
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Install code-server
sudo npm install -g code-server
```

### Configure code-server

Create a configuration file for code-server:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/code-server
echo '{
  "bind": "127.0.0.1:8080",
  "auth": "none",
  "cert": false
}' > ~/.config/code-server/config.json
```

This configuration disables password authentication, as only devices on your Tailscale network will be able to access it.

### Run code-server

Start code-server:

```bash
code-server ~/.config/code-server/config.json
```

You can access code-server at `http://localhost:8080`, but we'll set up Caddy to proxy this securely.

## Step 2: Install Caddy

### Installation

Install Caddy using the official script:

```bash
sudo bash -c 'curl -1sLf \
  "https://github.com/caddyserver/install/releases/latest/download/install.sh" | \
  sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin caddy'
```

### Configure Caddy

Create a Caddyfile to proxy requests to code-server:

```bash
mkdir -p /etc/caddy
echo '{
  http_port = 80
  https_port = 443
}

yourdomain.com, *.yourdomain.com {
        # Set this path to your site's directory.

         tls /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem
        # sudo certbot certonly --manual --manual-auth-hook /etc/letsencrypt/acme-dns-auth.py --preferred-challenges dns --debug-challenges -d \*.yourdomain.com -d yourdomain.com

        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
}' > /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

This configuration does the following:

- Listens on port 80 and 443.
- Redirects HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
- Proxies HTTPS traffic to code-server running on `127.0.0.1:8080`.

### Run Caddy

Start Caddy:

```bash
sudo caddy run --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

Caddy will automatically obtain a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate for your domain if you configure it.

## Step 3: Install and Configure Tailscale

### Installation

Install Tailscale:

- **Linux**:

  ```bash
  curl https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sudo bash
  ```

- **macOS**:

  ```bash
  brew install tailscale/tap/tailscale
  ```

- **Windows**: Download from [Tailscale's website](https://tailscale.com/download/).

### Join Tailscale

Run:

```bash
tailscale up
```

Follow the instructions to log in and join a Tailscale network. For personal use, you can create a new account or join an existing one.

### Configure Tailscale DNS

Tailscale assigns each device a DNS name like `your_device_name.your_tailscale_domain.ts.net`. You can use this DNS name to access your code-server instance.

## Step 4: Accessing code-server Remotely

### Find Your Tailscale DNS Name

Run:

```bash
tailscale status
```

Look for the `DNS name` field, which will be something like `your_device_name.your_tailscale_domain.ts.net`.

### Access code-server Over the Internet

Open a web browser and navigate to:

```
https://yourdomain.com
```

You should be redirected to `https://yourdomain.com` and prompted to log in with the password you set for code-server.

## Step 5: Securing Your Setup

### Firewall Rules

Ensure that only Tailscale traffic can access your services. Since Tailscale uses its own network, you can rely on its security measures, but it's good practice to restrict access further if needed.

### Optional: Use a Custom Domain

If you have a custom domain, you can point a DNS record to your Tailscale DNS name and configure Caddy to use your domain.

1. **Add a CNAME record** in your DNS provider pointing, e.g., `dev.yourdomain.com` to `your_device_name.your_tailscale_domain.ts.net`.
2. **Update your Caddyfile**:

   ```caddy
   {
     http_port = 80
     https_port = 443
   }

   dev.yourdomain.com {
     reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
   }

   :80 {
     redir https://{host}{uri}
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Caddy**:

   ```bash
   sudo caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
   ```

Now, you can access code-server at `https://dev.yourdomain.com`.

## Step 6: Setting Up Certbot for SSL Certificates

### Installation

Install Certbot:

```bash
sudo apt-get install certbot
```

### Obtain SSL Certificates

Run the following command to obtain SSL certificates for your domain:

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns -d yourdomain.com -d *.yourdomain.com
```

Follow the instructions to verify domain ownership by adding DNS TXT records. Once verified, Certbot will issue the SSL certificates.

### Update Caddyfile

Update your Caddyfile to use the obtained SSL certificates:

```caddy
yourdomain.com, *.yourdomain.com {
    tls /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
}
```

### Restart Caddy

Restart Caddy to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

## Conclusion

By setting up code-server with Caddy and Tailscale, you've created a secure, remote development environment accessible from anywhere. This setup leverages the strengths of each tool:

- **code-server** for a powerful, web-based development interface.
- **Caddy** for easy HTTPS and reverse proxying.
- **Tailscale** for secure, seamless networking.

Whether you're working from home, a caf√©, or anywhere else, this setup ensures you have a consistent, secure development environment at your fingertips.
