I've always liked the idea of writing blog posts. It's never been something that I truely wanted to do, but I've
always had a desire to write about things that interest me.

I typically use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which is powered by [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Markdown). All of my notes are published using [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) and are located at [here](https://notes.jasoncameron.

## How I Publish Posts

The process of publishing a post is pretty simple. I'll start by creating a new file in the `content/posts` directory.

```bash
hx ./content/posts/my-new-post.mdx
```

Then i'll add a frontmatter block to the top of the file. The frontmatter block is a block of YAML code that contains
all of the metadata for the post. The frontmatter block is required for all posts.

Typically I'll add just the title and description to the frontmatter block but the following is an example of a full frontmatter block.

```yaml
---
title: My New Post
description: A short description of my new post
published: false
date: "2024-12-16T01:52:21.756Z"
updatedOn: "2024-12-16T01:52:21.756Z"
---
```

you'll notice that I have two key pieces of metadata: `date` and `updatedOn`. These fields are particularly important for my workflow as they help me track when the post was created and when it was last updated. However, I ran into a small issue when I started automating the post-publishing process: the `updatedOn` timestamp wasn't updating when I made changes to the file after the initial creation.

Initially, my process for setting the `updatedOn` timestamp was manual. Every time I updated the post, I had to
remember to update this field in the frontmatter. But since I'm often forgetful, this was a problem.

### Automating the `updatedOn` Timestamp

To solve this problem, I decided to automate the process of updating the `updatedOn` timestamp using a script. My goal was to ensure that every time I made changes to a post and staged the file for commit, the `updatedOn` field would automatically update to the current time. This would save me from manually modifying the timestamp every time I edited a post, and it would ensure that the metadata stayed accurate and up-to-date.

#### Setting Up `lint-staged`

The first step was to integrate the automation into my workflow using `lint-staged`. `Lint-staged` allows me to run specific tasks on files that are staged for a Git commit. I set it up so that every time I staged a `.mdx` or `.md` file, it would automatically trigger a script to update the `updatedOn` field in the frontmatter.

I wrote a TypeScript script that used the `gray-matter` library to parse the frontmatter, check the `updatedOn` field, and update it with the current timestamp. This script would run every time I staged a file, making sure that the `updatedOn` field was always fresh and accurate without any manual intervention.
